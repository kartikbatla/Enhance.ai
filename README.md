**Backend:**
- Python (Flask)
- Pandas, NumPy
- CORS + File Upload APIs
- ngrok (for public testing)

**AI/ML:**
- Custom scripts for:
  - Missing Value Handling
  - Anomaly Detection (IQR)
  - Bias Detection
  - Data Cleaning Pipeline

**Installation**

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/kartikbatla/Enhance.ai.git
cd enhance-ai


**Usage**

Go to the Upload Section of the site.
Upload a .csv dataset file.

The backend processes:

Missing values
Anomalies
Duplicates
Bias analysis

A cleaned CSV file is auto-downloaded after processing.

**How It Works**

Upload: Users upload a CSV file through the frontend.

Preprocessing: Flask backend receives the file and applies:

Imputation for missing values
IQR-based anomaly removal
Duplicate removal

Bias Report: Bias is flagged based on value distributions.

Download: The cleaned CSV is sent back to the user.
